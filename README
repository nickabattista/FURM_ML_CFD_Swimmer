FOLDERS:

    [1] NN_Training: "all NN Training codes, including the training and 
                      test datasets and data transformation script"

        Included scripts:

            --> go_Go_NN_Training.m: 
                    - MAIN code to run to perform NN training
                    - Where you set NN hyperparameters for training

            --> Train_Artificial_Neural_Network.m:
                    - Script that actually performs NN training
                    - Is called from the go_Go_NN_Training.m script)

            --> scale_The_Output_Data.m:
                    - Transforms the Model Output for NN performance using 
                          (i) linear transformation
                         (ii) Box-Cox (power transform)
                        (iii) Standardization (z-Transformation)
                    - Is called from the go_Go_NN_Training.m script

            --> forward_propagate.m: 
                    - performs Forward Propagation on given input data
                    - each input parameter combination must be in column 
                      vector form
                    - will get used whenever using NN for prediction

            --> activation_function.m && act_function_PRIME.m:
                    - activation function and its derivative
                    - Note: set to ReLU by default; if switching to Sigmoid,
                      may need to SUBSTANTIALLY revise hyperparameter selection
                                    
    [2] NN_Prediction: codes that use the NN to prediction performance
            
            --> Prediction_Tamp_Freq.m:
                    - predicts performance across the (Tamp,f)-subspace
                      for constant values of (Hamp/Tamp, lambda, xB*)
                    - plots speed and power across the subspace
            
            --> Prediction_Errors.m:
                    - performs NN error analysis, i.e., how well the 
                      NN recovers the training dataset and predicts the 
                      test dataset.
                    - provides qualitative plots and error statistics
                
            --> scale_Input_Parameters_for_NN.m: 
                    - scales model input parameters from their actual real 
                      values to [-1,1] for NN prediction
